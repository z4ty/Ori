        <div><p>The skills in Ori are a big part of the game, being part of the story and helping and enhancing your gameplay. Each skill has its individuality and utility, being crucial for the game's progression. The image above shows all the skills from the first game.</p>
        <p>There are two possible ways to obtain these skills: As the game's story progresses, or by finding the Ancestral Trees. They are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spirit Flame</li>
            <li>Wall Jump</li>
            <li>Charge Flame</li>
            <li>Double Jump</li>
            <li>Bash</li>
            <li>Stomp</li>
            <li>Kuro's Feather</li>
            <li>Climb</li>
            <li>Charge Jump</li>
            <li>Light Burst</li>
            <li>Dash</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The only two skills that are not obtained through the Ancestral Trees are the Spirit Flame, which is obtained at the beginning of the game, and Kuro's Feather, which is obtained after Ori distracts Kuro who was blocking an area of the game. It is also worth noting that two of these 11 skills are NOT part of the original game. They were made available in the Definitive Edition of Ori and The Blind Forest, and these skills are: Dash and Light Burst.</p>

        <div>
            <p>The skills in the second game are more complete and complex, and we also have a greater variety of them and how to obtain them. In Will of the Wisps we have a new mechanic where we must select which skills we want to use at that moment, so you must select them according to what you need, as in the image</p>
        
            <p>Just like in the first game, there are several ways to get the skills, and unlike Blind Forest, here there are three ways to get them: Through the game's progress, finding the Ancestral Trees of Niwen or just buying them from Opher (NPC who teaches and upgrades skills). And they are: </p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Spirit Edge</li>
                <li>Regenerate</li>
                <li>Double Jump</li>
                <li>Spirit Arc</li>
                <li>Bash</li>
                <li>Dash</li>
                <li>Grapple</li>
                <li>Light Burst</li>
                <li>Flash</li>
                <li>Swim Dash</li>
                <li>Burrow</li>
                <li>Launch</li>
                <li>Ancestral Light</li>
                <li>Sentry</li>
                <li>Spirit Smash</li>
                <li>Spirit Star</li>
                <li>Spike</li>
                <li>Blaze</li>
                <li>Charge Blaze</li>
                <li>Water Breath</li>
                <li>Fast Travel</li>
                <li>Flap</li>
                <li>Glide</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>As there are more ways to get the skills, we will mention here how to get them. The skills that are obtained through the game's story progression are: Flap and Glide. The ones that are bought are: Sentry, Spirit Smash, Spirit Star, Spike, Blaze, Water Breath and Fast Travel. The rest of the skills are found by finding the Ancestral Trees.</p>
